        <p>You don’t need to be a robot to be productive. You can make spontaneous
             decisions and pursue new opportunities without sacrificing your work ethic.
              More fun outside your work can actually lead
               to more work being done.</p>

        <p>The more time you study the more work you accomplish. The more work you accomplish,
           the better your grades. Ergo, straight A’s imply more work. Right? Then how do you 
           explain me and my interview subjects…</p>

        <p>The most common trait you will consistently observe in accomplished people is an obsession with completion. Once a
           project falls into their horizon, they crave, almost compulsively, to finish it. If they’re organized,
            this might happen in scheduled chunks. If they’re not “like many” this might happen in all-nighters. 
            But they get it done. Fast and consistently.</p>

          <p>When you have few opinions about a subject, you also don’t have any wrong opinions.  The fresh perspective of a beginner does have an advantage:
             it doesn’t come with the baggage of bad advice.</p>

          <p>Acing exams isn’t the only goal of learning. Life is full of opportunities for learning things well that will never have a final test.

              Learning another language is a goal many people have. It’s also one that many people stumble on. They get stuck,
              give up and maybe even convince themselves they don’t have the right “gene” for learning languages..</p>
